Abstract
There is a wide range of activity in the higher education sector labelled ‘students as partners’
and ‘co-creation in learning and teaching’. Several frameworks have been proposed to map
and categorise existing partnership and co-creation roles, activities, research, and practice. In
this paper, I synthesise some of these frameworks to illustrate how the predominant focus in
the international literature has been on partnership projects that select small groups of often
already super-engaged or privileged students to participate. In contrast, co-creation in learning
and teaching, embedded within the curriculum and involving a whole class of students, has
been largely overlooked. I explore the potential of co-creating learning and teaching with a
whole class of students (including face-to-face, blended, and online settings, and including
lectures, tutorials, laboratories, and other methods of teaching); in other words, it is co-creation
integral to students’ programmes and courses of study. I argue that whole-class approaches to
co-creation may be inherently more inclusive of students than other approaches to co-creation
and that this approach both relies upon, and contributes towards, building positive relationships
between staff and students, and between students and students. I explore some of the
challenges of whole-class co-creation in learning and teaching, and I also argue that the
benefits suggest this is currently an underutilised and researched approach internationally.

Introduction to co-creating learning and teaching
In higher education, there has been rising interest in research and practice about ‘students as
partners’ and co-created learning and teaching (Cook-Sather et al. 2014; Dunne 2016;
Mercer-Mapstone et al. 2017). Although relatively widespread, this work has taken place
predominantly in the USA, Canada, UK, Australia, and Scandinavia, and Dunne (2016)
highlights that people are using many terms to describe this work. One commonly used term
is student engagement, which refers to a very broad range of activities universities employ to
motivate and interest students, as well as the time and effort students give to meaningful
activities (Kuh 2009). Student engagement in the UK refers to both engagement in learning
and teaching as well as engagement in student representation and governance systems. Student
engagement also refers to low levels of engagement, such as a student turning up to class, as
well as to high levels of engagement, such as a student going beyond course requirements. In
contrast, partnership or ‘students as partners’ refers to a much deeper level of student
involvement and agency. Cook-Sather et al. (2014: 6–7) define partnership in learning and
teaching as ‘a collaborative, reciprocal process through which all participants have the
opportunity to contribute equally, although not necessarily in the same ways, to curricular or
pedagogical conceptualization, decision making, implementation, investigation, or analysis’. A
third term, co-creation, has been described by Ryan and Tilbury (2013) as a new pedagogical
idea that emphasises learner empowerment. Bovill et al. (2016: 197) suggest that ‘one way to
conceptualise co-creation is occupying the space in between student engagement and partnership,
to suggest a meaningful collaboration between students and staff, with students becoming
more active participants in the learning process, constructing understanding and resources with
academic staff.’ Another related, but slightly broader term is participatory design. Participatory
design refers to a collaboration of a group of stakeholders (often including external participants
as well as teachers and students) in the design and development of initiatives, which can
include the curriculum. All stakeholders’ expertise is valued, but there is a strong focus on
development of new technology and school-level design in much of the participatory design
literature (DiSalvo et al. 2017) and students are often considered informants or testers rather
than partners with high levels of agency (Martens et al. 2019).
The terms, students as partners, partnership, and co-creation of learning and teaching are
often used interchangeably. I have chosen to use the term co-creation predominantly in this
paper for a number of reasons: co-creation does not assume the level of equality sometimes
implied by partnership, teaching staff are sometimes resistant to using the term partnership (my
experience suggests some colleagues find the radical overtones of the term threatening and
they disengage from conversations about partnership), and the term ‘students as partners’ has
been critiqued for only naming one of the partners involved in the partnership (Cook-Sather
2018). Outside of an ‘inner partnership circle’ (made up of key authors of partnership articles
and editors of partnership journals), I have found that many staff and students prefer to talk of
striving for meaningful relationships, which may, due to the nature of higher education
structures and assessment processes, fall short of what many consider to be true partnership.
However, they are often keen to discuss students’ active participation, learner empowerment,
shared decision-making, student agency, and negotiation of learning and teaching under the
umbrella of co-creation.
There is huge variation in the types of co-creation being enacted around the world, with
work focusing on different activities, actors, and aims, for example, students co-researching
university-wide projects and acting as change agents (Dunne and Zandstra 2011), students
undertaking research and scholarship projects with staff (Werder and Otis 2010), student
representatives collaborating with university staff on committees for quality assurance and
enhancement purposes (Luescher-Mamashela 2013; Buckley 2014), students participating in
course design review committees (Mihans et al. 2008; Rock et al. 2015), students as consultants
providing feedback on teaching observations (Cook-Sather et al. 2014; Huxham et al.
2017), students designing their own essay titles (Cook-Sather et al. 2014), students and
teachers co-assessing work (Deeley 2014), students co-designing courses and curricula
(Bovill 2014; Delpish et al. 2010), students co-evaluating courses (Bovill et al. 2010), students
and staff writing collaboratively (Marquis et al. 2016), and students involved in teaching and
designing academic development work (Kandiko Howson and Weller 2016). Cook-Sather
et al. (2014: 209) have likened this to a ‘partnership movement’, but it is a movement
embracing a diversity of focus, motivations, methods, values, and outcomes. One of the
challenges raised by this rich diversity is ensuring clarity about the nature of work being
described, researched, and discussed internationally. For researchers to build upon existing
evidence, and to enable deeper discussions and understandings to develop within the field, this
clarity is currently much needed.
In response, Bovill et al. (2016) outlined a typology of four roles that students adopt in cocreation
work: representative, consultant, co-researcher, and pedagogical co-designer. There
can often be overlap between the roles, but this model enables us to distinguish between the
student representative role, which tends to be an elected role involving a small group of
students representing a larger group of students; the consultant or intern role, which often
involves students being selected by staff, and usually paid to collaborate on projects; and the
co-research and pedagogical co-designer roles, where students may or may not be selected
depending on if teachers choose to work with a small group or a whole class of students. In an
alternative categorisation, Buckley (2014) has suggested that student engagement work (which
encompasses much partnership and co-creation work) divides into two main areas of focus: the
pedagogical and the political, with the former focused on learning and teaching and the latter
focused on university governance. Finally, in a third typology, Bryson et al. (2015) propose
that existing student partnership work can be categorised by the students who are involved in
partnership. Model A partnership is work that involves only a small selection of students
working with staff, and model B partnership is work involving all students within the
curriculum. There are further related frameworks that I have not included here in order to
avoid unnecessary complexity. Bovill and Woolmer (2018: 5) distinguish between co-creation
of the curriculum (co-design of a programme or course, usually before the programme or
course takes place) and co-creation in the curriculum (co-design of learning and teaching
within a course or programme usually during the course or programme). In this paper, I focus
specifically on whole-class co-creation in learning and teaching (co-creation taking place
involving all students studying a course as the course unfolds). In the next section, I will
explain this concept further and provide examples.
Whole-class approaches to co-creation in learning and teaching
Whole-class co-creation in learning and teaching involves inviting a whole group of students
who are studying together in any teaching setting face-to-face or online, to actively collaborate
and negotiate with the teacher and each other, elements of the learning process. This might
include negotiation of the content or subject matter, the purpose of their work, the teaching
approach, the many ways in which they can work and learn together, or their preferred
approach to evaluation.When I refer to co-created learning and teaching, I include assessment.
I could use the term co-created curriculum, but in this paper I purposely avoid the term
curriculum to avoid further complexity due to the widespread lack of agreement over how
higher education curriculum is defined and the resulting influence on what students are invited
to co-create (Bovill and Woolmer 2018). Co-creation overlaps with the concept of active
learning, which aims to move the student from adopting a passive role in learning to an active
role involving interaction between teacher and students, and between students and students.
Active learning practices and definitions vary, but it often involves students participating,
interacting, or contributing, whether mentally or physically, in activities to gather information,
to problem-solve, and to reflect upon knowledge. This often involves, for example, activities
such as reading, writing, discussion, and small group work, as well as values and attitude
exploration (Bonwell and Eison 1991; Freeman et al. 2014; Michael 2006). In co-creation, the
purpose, approaches, and outcomes of learning and teaching are jointly negotiated and there is
a shared responsibility for learning that implies a greater level of student agency and empowerment
than in active learning. Co-creation involves developing deeper relationships between
student and teacher, and between students and other students. Education is perceived as a
shared endeavour where learning and teaching are done with students not to them (Cook-
Sather et al. 2014).
While there are many examples and significant discussion in the research literature of
partnership and co-creation projects involving small numbers of students, there are relatively
few examples in the international literature of whole-class co-creation in learning and teaching
within higher education (Bryson et al. 2015; Mercer-Mapstone et al. 2017). This lack of
attention to pedagogically embedded forms of co-creation between a teacher and a whole class
of students is a distinct weakness in the current literature, which this paper aims to highlight.
There are likely to be more instances of whole-class co-creation in practice that have not been
captured in written accounts, but which teachers who have a disposition towards more
democratic forms of teaching that encourage greater student agency, might describe as ‘just
the way I teach’. However, this highlights a key question about co-creation in learning and
teaching, namely, how does it differ from good teaching? It is perfectly possible for a student to
be engaged and to learn without co-creating learning and teaching. A teacher might use
research evidence to support using interactive teaching approaches for the benefit of students
(Freeman et al. 2014), but good teaching does not necessarily require a shift in the power
relations between teacher and students that is required for co-creation. Care is also needed not
to assume that good quality evidence-informed teaching involving active learning is common,
despite growing evidence that we should ‘question the continued use of traditional lecturing in
everyday practice’ (Freeman et al. 2014: 8413).
Another key consideration in discussing co-creation is to be careful about any claims made
about the scale of co-creation. In a recent UK research study, Mercer-Mapstone and Bovill
(2019) highlight that many institutional partnership schemes (the common terminology applied
to university-level schemes funding collaborative projects) that might be considered large scale
in fact reach less than 100 students per year because they involve multiple projects but each
project only includes small numbers of students (with a couple of exceptions). The authors
question whether some co-creation work that is considered small scale—such as whole-class cocreation
led by individual, motivated members of staff—are in actual fact reaching larger
numbers of students per year than many institutional schemes. Many ‘large scale schemes’ are
being administered and funded at a macro-level but with predominant influence and impact at
departmental level. In contrast, micro-level partnership activity within students’ programmes of
study is often considered small-scale and isolated despite involving potentially larger numbers of
students. This is a key point I wish to emphasise because it has substantial implications for
universities and departments wishing to increase co-creation activity. Several apparently isolated
but motivatedmembers of staff co-creating learning and teachingwith their classes could involve
